1034-121119-0000 CHAPTER NINETY NINE THE LAW WE HAVE SEEN HOW QUIETLY
1034-121119-0001 THE FACT BEING THAT EVERY ONE WAS TOO MUCH OCCUPIED IN HIS OR HER OWN AFFAIRS TO THINK OF THEIRS WE WILL LEAVE THE BANKER CONTEMPLATING THE ENORMOUS MAGNITUDE OF HIS DEBT BEFORE THE PHANTOM OF BANKRUPTCY AND FOLLOW THE BARONESS
1034-121119-0002 WHO AFTER BEING MOMENTARILY CRUSHED UNDER THE WEIGHT OF THE BLOW WHICH HAD STRUCK HER HAD GONE TO SEEK HER USUAL ADVISER LUCIEN DEBRAY THE BARONESS HAD LOOKED FORWARD TO THIS MARRIAGE AS A MEANS OF RIDDING HER OF A GUARDIANSHIP WHICH OVER A GIRL OF EUGENIE'S CHARACTER
1034-121119-0003 FOR IN THE TACIT RELATIONS WHICH MAINTAIN THE BOND OF FAMILY UNION THE MOTHER TO MAINTAIN HER ASCENDANCY OVER HER DAUGHTER MUST NEVER FAIL TO BE A MODEL OF WISDOM AND A TYPE OF PERFECTION NOW
1034-121119-0004 AN EXPRESSION WHICH SEEMED TO IMPLY THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD ALL HER MOTHER'S AMOROUS AND PECUNIARY RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE INTIMATE SECRETARY MOREOVER
1034-121119-0005 NOT ONLY BECAUSE HE WAS A SOURCE OF DISSENSION AND SCANDAL UNDER THE PATERNAL ROOF BUT BECAUSE SHE HAD AT ONCE CLASSED HIM IN THAT CATALOGUE OF BIPEDS WHOM PLATO ENDEAVORS TO WITHDRAW FROM THE APPELLATION OF MEN
1034-121119-0006 UNFORTUNATELY IN THIS WORLD OF OURS EACH PERSON VIEWS THINGS THROUGH A CERTAIN MEDIUM AND SO IS PREVENTED FROM SEEING IN THE SAME LIGHT AS OTHERS AND MADAME DANGLARS THEREFORE VERY MUCH REGRETTED THAT THE MARRIAGE OF EUGENIE HAD NOT TAKEN PLACE
1034-121119-0007 NOT ONLY BECAUSE THE MATCH WAS GOOD AND LIKELY TO INSURE THE HAPPINESS OF HER CHILD BUT BECAUSE IT WOULD ALSO SET HER AT LIBERTY SHE RAN THEREFORE TO DEBRAY WHO AFTER HAVING LIKE THE REST OF PARIS WITNESSED THE CONTRACT SCENE AND THE SCANDAL ATTENDING IT
1034-121119-0008 HAD RETIRED IN HASTE TO HIS CLUB WHERE HE WAS CHATTING WITH SOME FRIENDS UPON THE EVENTS WHICH SERVED AS A SUBJECT OF CONVERSATION FOR THREE FOURTHS OF THAT CITY KNOWN AS THE CAPITAL OF THE WORLD AT THE PRECISE TIME WHEN MADAME DANGLARS DRESSED IN BLACK AND CONCEALED IN A LONG VEIL
1034-121119-0009 WAS ASCENDING THE STAIRS LEADING TO DEBRAY'S APARTMENTS
1034-121119-0010 DEBRAY WAS OCCUPIED IN REPELLING THE INSINUATIONS OF A FRIEND WHO TRIED TO PERSUADE HIM
1034-121119-0011 STILL WHEN HE RECOLLECTED THE INDEPENDENT PROUD SPIRIT OF EUGENIE HE POSITIVELY REJECTED IT AS UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE THOUGH THE SAME THOUGHT AGAIN CONTINUALLY RECURRED AND FOUND A RESTING PLACE IN HIS HEART TEA PLAY
1034-121119-0012 AND THE CONVERSATION WHICH HAD BECOME INTERESTING DURING THE DISCUSSION OF SUCH SERIOUS AFFAIRS
1034-121119-0013 AWAITED THE RETURN OF DEBRAY IN THE LITTLE GREEN ROOM SEATED BETWEEN TWO BASKETS OF FLOWERS WHICH SHE HAD THAT MORNING SENT AND WHICH IT MUST BE CONFESSED
1034-121119-0014 WITH SO MUCH CARE THAT HIS ABSENCE WAS HALF EXCUSED IN THE EYES OF THE POOR WOMAN AT TWENTY MINUTES OF TWELVE MADAME DANGLARS TIRED OF WAITING RETURNED HOME WOMEN OF A CERTAIN GRADE ARE LIKE PROSPEROUS GRISETTES IN ONE RESPECT THEY SELDOM RETURN HOME AFTER TWELVE O'CLOCK
1034-121119-0015 THE BARONESS RETURNED TO THE HOTEL WITH AS MUCH CAUTION AS EUGENIE USED IN LEAVING IT SHE RAN LIGHTLY UP STAIRS AND WITH AN ACHING HEART ENTERED HER APARTMENT CONTIGUOUS AS WE KNOW TO THAT OF EUGENIE SHE WAS FEARFUL OF EXCITING ANY REMARK
1034-121119-0016 AND BELIEVED FIRMLY IN HER DAUGHTER'S INNOCENCE AND FIDELITY TO THE PATERNAL ROOF SHE LISTENED AT EUGENIE'S DOOR AND HEARING NO SOUND TRIED TO ENTER BUT THE BOLTS WERE IN PLACE MADAME DANGLARS THEN CONCLUDED THAT THE YOUNG GIRL HAD BEEN OVERCOME WITH THE TERRIBLE EXCITEMENT OF THE EVENING
1034-121119-0017 AND HAD GONE TO BED AND TO SLEEP SHE CALLED THE MAID AND QUESTIONED HER MADEMOISELLE EUGENIE SAID THE MAID
1034-121119-0018 AFTER WHICH THEY DESIRED ME TO LEAVE SAYING THAT THEY NEEDED ME NO LONGER
1034-121119-0019 MADAME DANGLARS THEREFORE WENT TO BED WITHOUT A SHADOW OF SUSPICION AND BEGAN TO MUSE OVER THE RECENT EVENTS IN PROPORTION AS HER MEMORY BECAME CLEARER THE OCCURRENCES OF THE EVENING WERE REVEALED IN THEIR TRUE LIGHT WHAT SHE HAD TAKEN FOR CONFUSION WAS A TUMULT
1034-121119-0020 WHO HAD BEEN AFFLICTED WITH AS SEVERE A BLOW THROUGH HER HUSBAND AND SON EUGENIE SHE SAID TO HERSELF IS LOST AND SO ARE WE THE AFFAIR AS IT WILL BE REPORTED WILL COVER US WITH SHAME
1034-121119-0021 FOR IN A SOCIETY SUCH AS OURS SATIRE INFLICTS A PAINFUL AND INCURABLE WOUND
1034-121119-0022 AND HER GLANCE WAS TURNED TOWARDS HEAVEN
1034-121119-0023 AND OUT OF A FAULT NAY EVEN A VICE SOMETIMES PRODUCES A BLESSING AND THEN HER THOUGHTS CLEAVING THROUGH SPACE LIKE A BIRD IN THE AIR RESTED ON CAVALCANTI THIS ANDREA WAS A WRETCH A ROBBER AN ASSASSIN
1034-121119-0024 AND YET HIS MANNERS SHOWED THE EFFECTS OF A SORT OF EDUCATION IF NOT A COMPLETE ONE
1034-121119-0025 SUPPORTED BY AN HONORABLE NAME HOW COULD SHE EXTRICATE HERSELF FROM THIS LABYRINTH TO WHOM WOULD SHE APPLY TO HELP HER OUT OF THIS PAINFUL SITUATION DEBRAY TO WHOM SHE HAD RUN WITH THE FIRST INSTINCT OF A WOMAN TOWARDS THE MAN SHE LOVES AND WHO YET BETRAYS HER
1034-121119-0026 DEBRAY COULD BUT GIVE HER ADVICE SHE MUST APPLY TO SOME ONE MORE POWERFUL THAN HE
1034-121119-0027 BUT NO ON REFLECTION THE PROCUREUR WAS NOT A MERCILESS MAN AND IT WAS NOT THE MAGISTRATE SLAVE TO HIS DUTIES BUT THE FRIEND THE LOYAL FRIEND WHO ROUGHLY BUT FIRMLY CUT INTO THE VERY CORE OF THE CORRUPTION
1034-121119-0028 IT WAS NOT THE EXECUTIONER BUT THE SURGEON WHO WISHED TO WITHDRAW THE HONOR OF DANGLARS FROM IGNOMINIOUS ASSOCIATION WITH THE DISGRACED YOUNG MAN THEY HAD PRESENTED TO THE WORLD AS THEIR SON IN LAW AND SINCE VILLEFORT THE FRIEND OF DANGLARS HAD ACTED IN THIS WAY
1034-121119-0029 NO ONE COULD SUPPOSE THAT HE HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY ACQUAINTED WITH OR HAD LENT HIMSELF TO ANY OF ANDREA'S INTRIGUES
1034-121119-0030 APPEARED TO THE BARONESS AS IF SHAPED FOR THEIR MUTUAL ADVANTAGE BUT THE INFLEXIBILITY OF THE PROCUREUR SHOULD STOP THERE SHE WOULD SEE HIM THE NEXT DAY AND IF SHE COULD NOT MAKE HIM FAIL IN HIS DUTIES AS A MAGISTRATE SHE WOULD AT LEAST
1034-121119-0031 OBTAIN ALL THE INDULGENCE HE COULD ALLOW SHE WOULD INVOKE THE PAST RECALL OLD RECOLLECTIONS SHE WOULD SUPPLICATE HIM BY THE REMEMBRANCE OF GUILTY YET HAPPY DAYS
1034-121119-0032 HE HAD ONLY TO TURN HIS EYES ON ONE SIDE AND ALLOW ANDREA TO FLY AND FOLLOW UP THE CRIME UNDER THAT SHADOW OF GUILT CALLED CONTEMPT OF COURT AND AFTER THIS REASONING SHE SLEPT EASILY
1034-121119-0033 AT NINE O'CLOCK NEXT MORNING SHE AROSE AND WITHOUT RINGING FOR HER MAID OR GIVING THE LEAST SIGN OF HER ACTIVITY SHE DRESSED HERSELF IN THE SAME SIMPLE STYLE AS ON THE PREVIOUS NIGHT THEN RUNNING DOWN STAIRS SHE LEFT THE HOTEL WALKED TO THE RUE DE PROVENCE
1034-121119-0034 FOR THE LAST MONTH THIS WRETCHED HOUSE HAD PRESENTED THE GLOOMY APPEARANCE OF A LAZARETTO INFECTED WITH THE PLAGUE SOME OF THE APARTMENTS WERE CLOSED WITHIN AND WITHOUT THE SHUTTERS WERE ONLY OPENED TO ADMIT A MINUTE'S AIR SHOWING THE SCARED FACE OF A FOOTMAN
1034-121119-0035 AND THE NEIGHBORS WOULD SAY TO EACH OTHER IN A LOW VOICE
1034-121119-0036 MADAME DANGLARS INVOLUNTARILY SHUDDERED AT THE DESOLATE ASPECT OF THE MANSION
1034-121119-0037 THREE TIMES DID THE BELL RING WITH A DULL HEAVY SOUND SEEMING TO PARTICIPATE IN THE GENERAL SADNESS BEFORE THE CONCIERGE APPEARED AND PEEPED THROUGH THE DOOR WHICH HE OPENED JUST WIDE ENOUGH TO ALLOW HIS WORDS TO BE HEARD
