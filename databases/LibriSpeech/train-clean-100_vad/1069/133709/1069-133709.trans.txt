1069-133709-0000 HAD LAID BEFORE HER A PAIR OF ALTERNATIVES NOW OF COURSE YOU'RE COMPLETELY YOUR OWN MISTRESS AND ARE AS FREE AS THE BIRD ON THE BOUGH I DON'T MEAN YOU WERE NOT SO BEFORE BUT YOU'RE AT PRESENT ON A DIFFERENT FOOTING
1069-133709-0001 PROPERTY ERECTS A KIND OF BARRIER YOU CAN DO A GREAT MANY THINGS IF YOU'RE RICH WHICH WOULD BE SEVERELY CRITICISED IF YOU WERE POOR YOU CAN GO AND COME YOU CAN TRAVEL ALONE YOU CAN HAVE YOUR OWN ESTABLISHMENT
1069-133709-0002 I MEAN OF COURSE IF YOU'LL TAKE A COMPANION SOME DECAYED GENTLEWOMAN WITH A DARNED CASHMERE AND DYED HAIR WHO PAINTS ON VELVET YOU DON'T THINK YOU'D LIKE THAT OF COURSE YOU CAN DO AS YOU PLEASE
1069-133709-0003 SHE'D KEEP PEOPLE OFF VERY WELL I THINK
1069-133709-0004 THAT IT'S A GREAT DEAL BETTER YOU SHOULD REMAIN WITH ME IN SPITE OF THERE BEING NO OBLIGATION IT'S BETTER FOR SEVERAL REASONS QUITE APART FROM YOUR LIKING IT I SHOULDN'T THINK YOU'D LIKE IT BUT I RECOMMEND YOU TO MAKE THE SACRIFICE
1069-133709-0005 SHE HAD A GREAT REGARD FOR WHAT WAS USUALLY DEEMED DECENT AND A YOUNG GENTLEWOMAN WITHOUT VISIBLE RELATIONS HAD ALWAYS STRUCK HER AS A FLOWER WITHOUT FOLIAGE
1069-133709-0006 WHEN SHE SAT IN HER DAMP WATERPROOF AND SKETCHED THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT EUROPE WOULD OFFER TO A YOUNG PERSON OF TASTE THIS HOWEVER WAS IN A GREAT MEASURE THE GIRL'S OWN FAULT SHE HAD GOT A GLIMPSE OF HER AUNT'S EXPERIENCE
1069-133709-0007 AND HER IMAGINATION CONSTANTLY ANTICIPATED THE JUDGEMENTS AND EMOTIONS OF A WOMAN WHO HAD VERY LITTLE OF THE SAME FACULTY APART FROM THIS MISSUS TOUCHETT HAD A GREAT MERIT SHE WAS AS HONEST AS A PAIR OF COMPASSES
1069-133709-0008 BUT WAS NEVER OVER INQUISITIVE AS REGARDS THE TERRITORY OF HER NEIGHBOUR ISABEL CAME AT LAST TO HAVE A KIND OF UNDEMONSTRABLE PITY FOR HER THERE SEEMED SOMETHING SO DREARY IN THE CONDITION OF A PERSON WHOSE NATURE HAD AS IT WERE
1069-133709-0009 SO LITTLE SURFACE OFFERED SO LIMITED A FACE TO THE ACCRETIONS OF HUMAN CONTACT NOTHING TENDER NOTHING SYMPATHETIC HAD EVER HAD A CHANCE TO FASTEN UPON IT
1069-133709-0010 NO WIND SOWN BLOSSOM NO FAMILIAR SOFTENING MOSS HER OFFERED HER PASSIVE EXTENT IN OTHER WORDS WAS ABOUT THAT OF A KNIFE EDGE ISABEL HAD REASON TO BELIEVE NONE THE LESS
1069-133709-0011 SHE WAS LEARNING TO SACRIFICE CONSISTENCY TO CONSIDERATIONS OF THAT INFERIOR ORDER FOR WHICH THE EXCUSE MUST BE FOUND IN THE PARTICULAR CASE IT WAS NOT TO THE CREDIT OF HER ABSOLUTE RECTITUDE
1069-133709-0012 THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE GONE THE LONGEST WAY ROUND TO FLORENCE IN ORDER TO SPEND A FEW WEEKS WITH HER INVALID SON
1069-133709-0013 THAT WHEN RALPH WISHED TO SEE HER HE WAS AT LIBERTY TO REMEMBER THAT PALAZZO CRESCENTINI CONTAINED A LARGE APARTMENT KNOWN AS THE QUARTER OF THE SIGNORINO I WANT TO ASK YOU SOMETHING
1069-133709-0014 ISABEL SAID TO THIS YOUNG MAN THE DAY AFTER HER ARRIVAL AT SAN REMO SOMETHING I'VE THOUGHT MORE THAN ONCE OF ASKING YOU BY LETTER BUT THAT I'VE HESITATED ON THE WHOLE TO WRITE ABOUT FACE TO FACE NEVERTHELESS
1069-133709-0015 WHAT DOES IT MATTER MY DEAR ISABEL WHETHER I KNEW MY FATHER WAS VERY OBSTINATE SO SAID THE GIRL YOU DID KNOW YES HE TOLD ME WE EVEN TALKED IT OVER A LITTLE
1069-133709-0016 ASKED ISABEL ABRUPTLY WHY AS A KIND OF COMPLIMENT A COMPLIMENT ON WHAT ON YOUR SO BEAUTIFULLY EXISTING HE LIKED ME TOO MUCH SHE PRESENTLY DECLARED THAT'S A WAY WE ALL HAVE
1069-133709-0017 IF I BELIEVED THAT I SHOULD BE VERY UNHAPPY FORTUNATELY I DON'T BELIEVE IT I WANT TO BE TREATED WITH JUSTICE I WANT NOTHING BUT THAT VERY GOOD BUT YOU MUST REMEMBER THAT JUSTICE TO A LOVELY BEING
1069-133709-0018 IS AFTER ALL A FLORID SORT OF SENTIMENT I'M NOT A LOVELY BEING HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN I'M ASKING SUCH ODIOUS QUESTIONS I MUST SEEM TO YOU DELICATE
1069-133709-0019 YOU SEEM TO ME TROUBLED SAID RALPH I AM TROUBLED ABOUT WHAT FOR A MOMENT SHE ANSWERED NOTHING THEN SHE BROKE OUT DO YOU THINK IT GOOD FOR ME SUDDENLY TO BE MADE SO RICH
1069-133709-0020 HENRIETTA DOESN'T OH HANG HENRIETTA SAID RALPH COARSELY IF YOU ASK ME I'M DELIGHTED AT IT IS THAT WHY YOUR FATHER DID IT FOR YOUR AMUSEMENT I DIFFER WITH MISS STACKPOLE
1069-133709-0021 RALPH WENT ON MORE GRAVELY I THINK IT VERY GOOD FOR YOU TO HAVE MEANS ISABEL LOOKED AT HIM WITH SERIOUS EYES I WONDER WHETHER YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR ME OR WHETHER YOU CARE IF I KNOW DEPEND UPON IT I CARE
1069-133709-0022 DON'T QUESTION YOUR CONSCIENCE SO MUCH IT WILL GET OUT OF TUNE LIKE A STRUMMED PIANO KEEP IT FOR GREAT OCCASIONS DON'T TRY SO MUCH TO FORM YOUR CHARACTER IT'S LIKE TRYING TO PULL OPEN A TIGHT TENDER YOUNG ROSE
1069-133709-0023 LIVE AS YOU LIKE BEST AND YOUR CHARACTER WILL TAKE CARE OF ITSELF MOST THINGS ARE GOOD FOR YOU THE EXCEPTIONS ARE VERY RARE AND A COMFORTABLE INCOME'S NOT ONE OF THEM RALPH PAUSED SMILING
1069-133709-0024 ISABEL HAD LISTENED QUICKLY YOU'VE TOO MUCH POWER OF THOUGHT ABOVE ALL TOO MUCH CONSCIENCE RALPH ADDED IT'S OUT OF ALL REASON THE NUMBER OF THINGS YOU THINK WRONG PUT BACK YOUR WATCH DIET YOUR FEVER
1069-133709-0025 IT'S NEVER WRONG TO DO THAT SHE HAD LISTENED EAGERLY AS I SAY AND IT WAS HER NATURE TO UNDERSTAND QUICKLY I WONDER IF YOU APPRECIATE WHAT YOU SAY IF YOU DO YOU TAKE A GREAT RESPONSIBILITY YOU FRIGHTEN ME A LITTLE
1069-133709-0026 BUT I THINK I'M RIGHT SAID RALPH PERSISTING IN CHEER ALL THE SAME WHAT YOU SAY IS VERY TRUE ISABEL PURSUED YOU COULD SAY NOTHING MORE TRUE I'M ABSORBED IN MYSELF I LOOK AT LIFE TOO MUCH AS A DOCTOR'S PRESCRIPTION
1069-133709-0027 WHY INDEED SHOULD WE PERPETUALLY BE THINKING WHETHER THINGS ARE GOOD FOR US AS IF WE WERE PATIENTS LYING IN A HOSPITAL WHY SHOULD I BE SO AFRAID OF NOT DOING RIGHT AS IF IT MATTERED TO THE WORLD WHETHER I DO RIGHT OR WRONG
1069-133709-0028 YOU'RE A CAPITAL PERSON TO ADVISE SAID RALPH YOU TAKE THE WIND OUT OF MY SAILS SHE LOOKED AT HIM AS IF SHE HAD NOT HEARD HIM THOUGH SHE WAS FOLLOWING OUT THE TRAIN OF REFLEXION WHICH HE HIMSELF HAD KINDLED
1069-133709-0029 A LARGE FORTUNE MEANS FREEDOM AND I'M AFRAID OF THAT IT'S SUCH A FINE THING AND ONE SHOULD MAKE SUCH A GOOD USE OF IT IF ONE SHOULDN'T ONE WOULD BE ASHAMED AND ONE MUST KEEP THINKING IT'S A CONSTANT EFFORT
1069-133709-0030 I'M NOT SURE IT'S NOT A GREATER HAPPINESS TO BE POWERLESS FOR WEAK PEOPLE I'VE NO DOUBT IT'S A GREATER HAPPINESS FOR WEAK PEOPLE THE EFFORT NOT TO BE CONTEMPTIBLE MUST BE GREAT AND HOW DO YOU KNOW I'M NOT WEAK ISABEL ASKED
1069-133709-0031 THE GATE OF ADMIRATIONS ITALY AS YET IMPERFECTLY SEEN AND FELT STRETCHED BEFORE HER AS A LAND OF PROMISE A LAND IN WHICH A LOVE OF THE BEAUTIFUL MIGHT BE COMFORTED BY ENDLESS KNOWLEDGE
1069-133709-0032 WHENEVER SHE STROLLED UPON THE SHORE WITH HER COUSIN AND SHE WAS THE COMPANION OF HIS DAILY WALK SHE LOOKED ACROSS THE SEA WITH LONGING EYES TO WHERE SHE KNEW THAT GENOA LAY
1069-133709-0033 SHE WAS GLAD TO PAUSE HOWEVER ON THE EDGE OF THIS LARGER ADVENTURE THERE WAS SUCH A THRILL EVEN IN THE PRELIMINARY HOVERING IT AFFECTED HER MOREOVER AS A PEACEFUL INTERLUDE AS A HUSH OF THE DRUM AND FIFE IN A CAREER WHICH SHE HAD LITTLE WARRANT
1069-133709-0034 AS YET FOR REGARDING AS AGITATED BUT WHICH NEVERTHELESS SHE WAS CONSTANTLY PICTURING TO HERSELF BY THE LIGHT OF HER HOPES HER FEARS HER FANCIES HER AMBITIONS HER PREDILECTIONS
1069-133709-0035 MADAME MERLE HAD PREDICTED TO MISSUS TOUCHETT THAT AFTER THEIR YOUNG FRIEND HAD PUT HER HAND INTO HER POCKET HALF A DOZEN TIMES SHE WOULD BE RECONCILED TO THE IDEA THAT IT HAD BEEN FILLED BY A MUNIFICENT UNCLE
1069-133709-0036 GROWN USED TO FEELING RICH THE CONSCIOUSNESS IN QUESTION FOUND A PROPER PLACE IN RATHER A DENSE LITTLE GROUP OF IDEAS THAT SHE HAD ABOUT HERSELF AND OFTEN IT WAS BY NO MEANS THE LEAST AGREEABLE
1069-133709-0037 IT TOOK PERPETUALLY FOR GRANTED A THOUSAND GOOD INTENTIONS SHE LOST HERSELF IN A MAZE OF VISIONS THE FINE THINGS TO BE DONE BY A RICH INDEPENDENT GENEROUS GIRL WHO TOOK A LARGE HUMAN VIEW OF OCCASIONS AND OBLIGATIONS
1069-133709-0038 WERE SUBLIME IN THE MASS HER FORTUNE THEREFORE BECAME TO HER MIND A PART OF HER BETTER SELF IT GAVE HER IMPORTANCE GAVE HER EVEN TO HER OWN IMAGINATION A CERTAIN IDEAL BEAUTY
1069-133709-0039 WHICH IN SPITE OF INCREASING DISTANCE WERE STILL SUFFICIENTLY SALIENT THEY WERE RECOGNISABLE WITHOUT DIFFICULTY
1069-133709-0040 SHE COULD SUMMON BACK HER FAITH IN CASE OF NEED WITH AN EFFORT BUT THE EFFORT WAS OFTEN PAINFUL EVEN WHEN THE REALITY HAD BEEN PLEASANT THE PAST WAS APT TO LOOK DEAD AND ITS REVIVAL RATHER TO SHOW THE
1069-133709-0041 LIVID LIGHT OF A JUDGEMENT DAY THE GIRL MOREOVER WAS NOT PRONE TO TAKE FOR GRANTED THAT SHE HERSELF LIVED IN THE MIND OF OTHERS
1069-133709-0042 SHE WAS CAPABLE OF BEING WOUNDED BY THE DISCOVERY THAT SHE HAD BEEN FORGOTTEN BUT OF ALL LIBERTIES THE ONE SHE HERSELF FOUND SWEETEST WAS THE LIBERTY TO FORGET SHE HAD NOT GIVEN HER LAST SHILLING SENTIMENTALLY SPEAKING
1069-133709-0043 EITHER TO CASPAR GOODWOOD OR TO LORD WARBURTON AND YET COULDN'T BUT FEEL THEM APPRECIABLY IN DEBT TO HER SHE HAD OF COURSE REMINDED HERSELF THAT SHE WAS TO HEAR FROM MISTER GOODWOOD AGAIN BUT THIS WAS NOT TO BE FOR ANOTHER YEAR AND A HALF
1069-133709-0044 AND IN THAT TIME A GREAT MANY THINGS MIGHT HAPPEN SHE HAD INDEED FAILED TO SAY TO HERSELF THAT HER AMERICAN SUITOR MIGHT FIND SOME OTHER GIRL MORE COMFORTABLE TO WOO BECAUSE THOUGH IT WAS CERTAIN MANY OTHER GIRLS WOULD PROVE SO
1069-133709-0045 SHE HAD NOT THE SMALLEST BELIEF THAT THIS MERIT WOULD ATTRACT HIM BUT SHE REFLECTED THAT SHE HERSELF MIGHT KNOW THE HUMILIATION OF CHANGE MIGHT REALLY FOR THAT MATTER COME TO THE END OF THE THINGS THAT WERE NOT CASPAR
1069-133709-0046 A CLEAR AND QUIET HARBOUR ENCLOSED BY A BRAVE GRANITE BREAKWATER BUT THAT DAY COULD ONLY COME IN ITS ORDER AND SHE COULDN'T WAIT FOR IT WITH FOLDED HANDS THAT LORD WARBURTON SHOULD CONTINUE TO CHERISH HER IMAGE
1069-133709-0047 SEEMED TO HER MORE THAN A NOBLE HUMILITY OR AN ENLIGHTENED PRIDE OUGHT TO WISH TO RECKON WITH SHE HAD SO DEFINITELY UNDERTAKEN TO PRESERVE NO RECORD OF WHAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN THEM THAT A CORRESPONDING EFFORT ON HIS OWN PART
1069-133709-0048 WOULD BE EMINENTLY JUST THIS WAS NOT AS IT MAY SEEM MERELY A THEORY TINGED WITH SARCASM ISABEL CANDIDLY BELIEVED THAT HIS LORDSHIP WOULD IN THE USUAL PHRASE GET OVER HIS DISAPPOINTMENT
1069-133709-0049 HE HAD BEEN DEEPLY AFFECTED THIS SHE BELIEVED AND SHE WAS STILL CAPABLE OF DERIVING PLEASURE FROM THE BELIEF BUT IT WAS ABSURD THAT A MAN BOTH SO INTELLIGENT AND SO HONOURABLY DEALT WITH
1069-133709-0050 SHOULD CULTIVATE A SCAR OUT OF PROPORTION TO ANY WOUND ENGLISHMEN LIKED MOREOVER TO BE COMFORTABLE SAID ISABEL AND THERE COULD BE LITTLE COMFORT FOR LORD WARBURTON IN THE LONG RUN IN BROODING OVER A SELF SUFFICIENT AMERICAN GIRL
1069-133709-0051 WHO HAD BEEN BUT A CASUAL ACQUAINTANCE SHE FLATTERED HERSELF THAT SHOULD SHE HEAR FROM ONE DAY TO ANOTHER THAT HE HAD MARRIED SOME YOUNG WOMAN OF HIS OWN COUNTRY WHO HAD DONE MORE TO DESERVE HIM
1069-133709-0052 SHE SHOULD RECEIVE THE NEWS WITHOUT A PANG EVEN OF SURPRISE IT WOULD HAVE PROVED THAT HE BELIEVED SHE WAS FIRM WHICH WAS WHAT SHE WISHED TO SEEM TO HIM
