1088-129236-0000 EVERY PROMISE OF THE SOUL HAS INNUMERABLE FULFILMENTS EACH OF ITS JOYS RIPENS INTO A NEW WANT NATURE UNCONTAINABLE FLOWING FORELOOKING
1088-129236-0001 IN THE FIRST SENTIMENT OF KINDNESS ANTICIPATES ALREADY A BENEVOLENCE WHICH SHALL LOSE ALL PARTICULAR REGARDS IN ITS GENERAL LIGHT THE INTRODUCTION TO THIS FELICITY IS IN A PRIVATE AND TENDER RELATION OF ONE TO ONE WHICH IS THE ENCHANTMENT OF HUMAN LIFE
1088-129236-0002 UNITES HIM TO HIS RACE PLEDGES HIM TO THE DOMESTIC AND CIVIC RELATIONS CARRIES HIM WITH NEW SYMPATHY INTO NATURE ENHANCES THE POWER OF THE SENSES OPENS THE IMAGINATION ADDS TO HIS CHARACTER HEROIC AND SACRED ATTRIBUTES
1088-129236-0003 ESTABLISHES MARRIAGE AND GIVES PERMANENCE TO HUMAN SOCIETY THE NATURAL ASSOCIATION OF THE SENTIMENT OF LOVE WITH THE HEYDAY OF THE BLOOD SEEMS TO REQUIRE THAT IN ORDER TO PORTRAY IT IN VIVID TINTS WHICH EVERY YOUTH AND MAID SHOULD CONFESS TO BE TRUE TO THEIR THROBBING EXPERIENCE
1088-129236-0004 ONE MUST NOT BE TOO OLD THE DELICIOUS FANCIES OF YOUTH REJECT THE LEAST SAVOR OF A MATURE PHILOSOPHY AS CHILLING WITH AGE AND PEDANTRY THEIR PURPLE BLOOM
1088-129236-0005 AND THEREFORE I KNOW I INCUR THE IMPUTATION OF UNNECESSARY HARDNESS AND STOICISM FROM THOSE WHO COMPOSE THE COURT AND PARLIAMENT OF LOVE BUT FROM THESE FORMIDABLE CENSORS I SHALL APPEAL TO MY SENIORS
1088-129236-0006 FOR IT IS TO BE CONSIDERED THAT THIS PASSION OF WHICH WE SPEAK THOUGH IT BEGIN WITH THE YOUNG YET FORSAKES NOT THE OLD OR RATHER SUFFERS NO ONE WHO IS TRULY ITS SERVANT TO GROW OLD
1088-129236-0007 GLOWS AND ENLARGES UNTIL IT WARMS AND BEAMS UPON MULTITUDES OF MEN AND WOMEN UPON THE UNIVERSAL HEART OF ALL AND SO LIGHTS UP THE WHOLE WORLD AND ALL NATURE WITH ITS GENEROUS FLAMES
1088-129236-0008 ONLY IT IS TO BE HOPED THAT BY PATIENCE AND THE MUSES AID WE MAY ATTAIN TO THAT INWARD VIEW OF THE LAW WHICH SHALL DESCRIBE A TRUTH EVER YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL SO CENTRAL THAT IT SHALL COMMEND ITSELF TO THE EYE AT WHATEVER ANGLE BEHOLDEN
1088-129236-0009 AND THE FIRST CONDITION IS THAT WE MUST LEAVE A TOO CLOSE AND LINGERING ADHERENCE TO FACTS AND STUDY THE SENTIMENT AS IT APPEARED IN HOPE AND NOT IN HISTORY FOR EACH MAN SEES HIS OWN LIFE DEFACED AND DISFIGURED
1088-129236-0010 WHICH HAVE GIVEN HIM SINCEREST INSTRUCTION AND NOURISHMENT HE WILL SHRINK AND MOAN ALAS I KNOW NOT WHY BUT INFINITE COMPUNCTIONS EMBITTER IN MATURE LIFE THE REMEMBRANCES OF BUDDING JOY AND COVER EVERY BELOVED NAME
1088-129236-0011 DWELL CARE AND CANKER AND FEAR WITH THOUGHT WITH THE IDEAL IS IMMORTAL HILARITY THE ROSE OF JOY ROUND IT ALL THE MUSES SING BUT GRIEF CLEAVES TO NAMES AND PERSONS AND THE PARTIAL INTERESTS OF TO DAY AND YESTERDAY
1088-129236-0012 THE STRONG BENT OF NATURE IS SEEN IN THE PROPORTION WHICH THIS TOPIC OF PERSONAL RELATIONS USURPS IN THE CONVERSATION OF SOCIETY WHAT DO WE WISH TO KNOW OF ANY WORTHY PERSON SO MUCH AS HOW HE HAS SPED IN THE HISTORY OF THIS SENTIMENT
1088-129236-0013 AND WHAT FASTENS ATTENTION IN THE INTERCOURSE OF LIFE LIKE ANY PASSAGE BETRAYING AFFECTION BETWEEN TWO PARTIES PERHAPS WE NEVER SAW THEM BEFORE AND NEVER SHALL MEET THEM AGAIN BUT WE SEE THEM EXCHANGE A GLANCE OR BETRAY A DEEP EMOTION AND WE ARE NO LONGER STRANGERS
1088-129236-0014 IT IS THE DAWN OF CIVILITY AND GRACE IN THE COARSE AND RUSTIC THE RUDE VILLAGE BOY TEASES THE GIRLS ABOUT THE SCHOOL HOUSE DOOR BUT TO DAY HE COMES RUNNING INTO THE ENTRY AND MEETS ONE FAIR CHILD DISPOSING HER SATCHEL
1088-129236-0015 HE HOLDS HER BOOKS TO HELP HER AND INSTANTLY IT SEEMS TO HIM AS IF SHE REMOVED HERSELF FROM HIM INFINITELY AND WAS A SACRED PRECINCT AMONG THE THRONG OF GIRLS HE RUNS RUDELY ENOUGH BUT ONE ALONE DISTANCES HIM
1088-129236-0016 FOR PERSONS ARE LOVE'S WORLD AND THE COLDEST PHILOSOPHER CANNOT RECOUNT THE DEBT OF THE YOUNG SOUL WANDERING HERE IN NATURE TO THE POWER OF LOVE WITHOUT BEING TEMPTED TO UNSAY AS TREASONABLE TO NATURE AUGHT DEROGATORY TO THE SOCIAL INSTINCTS
1088-129236-0017 YET THE REMEMBRANCE OF THESE VISIONS OUTLASTS ALL OTHER REMEMBRANCES AND IS A WREATH OF FLOWERS ON THE OLDEST BROWS BUT HERE IS A STRANGE FACT IT MAY SEEM TO MANY MEN IN REVISING THEIR EXPERIENCE
1088-129236-0018 THAT THEY HAVE NO FAIRER PAGE IN THEIR LIFE'S BOOK THAN THE DELICIOUS MEMORY OF SOME PASSAGES WHEREIN AFFECTION CONTRIVED TO GIVE A WITCHCRAFT SURPASSING THE DEEP ATTRACTION OF ITS OWN TRUTH TO A PARCEL OF ACCIDENTAL AND TRIVIAL CIRCUMSTANCES
1088-129236-0019 NO MAN EVER FORGOT THE VISITATIONS OF THAT POWER TO HIS HEART AND BRAIN WHICH CREATED ALL THINGS ANEW WHICH WAS THE DAWN IN HIM OF MUSIC POETRY AND ART WHICH MADE THE FACE OF NATURE RADIANT WITH PURPLE LIGHT
1088-129236-0020 THE MORNING AND THE NIGHT VARIED ENCHANTMENTS WHEN A SINGLE TONE OF ONE VOICE COULD MAKE THE HEART BOUND AND THE MOST TRIVIAL CIRCUMSTANCE ASSOCIATED WITH ONE FORM IS PUT IN THE AMBER OF MEMORY
1088-129236-0021 WHEN NO PLACE IS TOO SOLITARY AND NONE TOO SILENT FOR HIM WHO HAS RICHER COMPANY AND SWEETER CONVERSATION IN HIS NEW THOUGHTS THAN ANY OLD FRIENDS THOUGH BEST AND PUREST CAN GIVE HIM FOR THE FIGURES THE MOTIONS
1088-129236-0022 THE WORDS OF THE BELOVED OBJECT ARE NOT LIKE OTHER IMAGES WRITTEN IN WATER BUT AS PLUTARCH SAID ENAMELLED IN FIRE AND MAKE THE STUDY OF MIDNIGHT THOU ART NOT GONE BEING GONE WHERE'ER THOU ART
1088-129236-0023 THY LOVING HEART IN THE NOON AND THE AFTERNOON OF LIFE WE STILL THROB AT THE RECOLLECTION OF DAYS WHEN HAPPINESS WAS NOT HAPPY ENOUGH BUT MUST BE DRUGGED WITH THE RELISH OF PAIN AND FEAR FOR HE TOUCHED THE SECRET OF THE MATTER WHO SAID OF LOVE
1088-129236-0024 ALL OTHER PLEASURES ARE NOT WORTH ITS PAINS AND WHEN THE DAY WAS NOT LONG ENOUGH BUT THE NIGHT TOO MUST BE CONSUMED IN KEEN RECOLLECTIONS WHEN THE HEAD BOILED ALL NIGHT ON THE PILLOW WITH THE GENEROUS DEED IT RESOLVED ON
1088-129236-0025 THE CLOUDS HAVE FACES AS HE LOOKS ON THEM THE TREES OF THE FOREST THE WAVING GRASS AND THE PEEPING FLOWERS HAVE GROWN INTELLIGENT AND HE ALMOST FEARS TO TRUST THEM WITH THE SECRET WHICH THEY SEEM TO INVITE YET NATURE SOOTHES AND SYMPATHIZES
1088-129236-0026 A MIDNIGHT BELL A PASSING GROAN THESE ARE THE SOUNDS WE FEED UPON BEHOLD THERE IN THE WOOD THE FINE MADMAN HE IS A PALACE OF SWEET SOUNDS AND SIGHTS HE DILATES HE IS TWICE A MAN
1088-129236-0027 HE WALKS WITH ARMS AKIMBO HE SOLILOQUIZES HE ACCOSTS THE GRASS AND THE TREES HE FEELS THE BLOOD OF THE VIOLET THE CLOVER AND THE LILY IN HIS VEINS AND HE TALKS WITH THE BROOK THAT WETS HIS FOOT
1088-129236-0028 THE HEATS THAT HAVE OPENED HIS PERCEPTIONS OF NATURAL BEAUTY HAVE MADE HIM LOVE MUSIC AND VERSE IT IS A FACT OFTEN OBSERVED THAT MEN HAVE WRITTEN GOOD VERSES UNDER THE INSPIRATION OF PASSION WHO CANNOT WRITE WELL UNDER ANY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES
1088-129236-0029 THE LIKE FORCE HAS THE PASSION OVER ALL HIS NATURE IT EXPANDS THE SENTIMENT IT MAKES THE CLOWN GENTLE AND GIVES THE COWARD HEART
1088-129236-0030 INTO THE MOST PITIFUL AND ABJECT IT WILL INFUSE A HEART AND COURAGE TO DEFY THE WORLD SO ONLY IT HAVE THE COUNTENANCE OF THE BELOVED OBJECT IN GIVING HIM TO ANOTHER IT STILL MORE GIVES HIM TO HIMSELF
