1235-135883-0000 HE WAS OBLIGED FROM TIME TO TIME TO VISIT HIS CORRESPONDENTS ON BUSINESS AND ONE DAY BEING UNDER THE NECESSITY OF GOING A LONG JOURNEY ON AN AFFAIR OF IMPORTANCE HE TOOK HORSE AND CARRIED WITH HIM A WALLET CONTAINING BISCUITS AND DATES
1235-135883-0001 BECAUSE HE HAD A GREAT DESERT TO PASS OVER WHERE HE COULD PROCURE NO SORT OF PROVISIONS HE ARRIVED WITHOUT ANY ACCIDENT AT THE END OF HIS JOURNEY AND HAVING DISPATCHED HIS AFFAIRS TOOK HORSE AGAIN IN ORDER TO RETURN HOME
1235-135883-0002 THE FOURTH DAY OF HIS JOURNEY HE WAS SO MUCH INCOMMODED BY THE HEAT OF THE SUN AND THE REFLECTION OF THAT HEAT FROM THE EARTH
1235-135883-0003 HAVING ALIGHTED HE TIED HIS HORSE TO A BRANCH AND SITTING DOWN BY THE FOUNTAIN TOOK SOME BISCUITS AND DATES OUT OF HIS WALLET AS HE ATE HIS DATES HE THREW THE SHELLS CARELESSLY IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS WHEN HE HAD FINISHED HIS REPAST
1235-135883-0004 BEING A GOOD MOOSULMAUN HE WASHED HIS HANDS FACE AND FEET AND SAID HIS PRAYERS BEFORE HE HAD FINISHED AND WHILE HE WAS YET ON HIS KNEES HE SAW A GENIE WHITE WITH AGE
1235-135883-0005 THE GENIE SPOKE TO HIM IN A TERRIBLE VOICE RISE THAT I MAY KILL THEE WITH THIS CIMETER AS THOU HAST KILLED MY SON AND ACCOMPANIED THESE WORDS WITH A FRIGHTFUL CRY
1235-135883-0006 THE MERCHANT BEING AS MUCH ALARMED AT THE HIDEOUS SHAPE OF THE MONSTER AS AT HIS THREATENING LANGUAGE ANSWERED HIM TREMBLING ALAS MY GOOD LORD OF WHAT CRIME CAN I BE GUILTY TOWARDS YOU THAT YOU SHOULD TAKE AWAY MY LIFE
1235-135883-0007 DEMANDED THE GENIE DID YOU NOT TAKE DATES OUT OF YOUR WALLET

1235-135883-0012 PERSISTING IN HIS RESOLUTION I MUST KILL THEE SINCE THOU HAST KILLED MY SON THEN TAKING THE MERCHANT BY THE ARM HE THREW HIM WITH HIS FACE ON THE GROUND AND LIFTED UP HIS CIMETER TO CUT OFF HIS HEAD THE MERCHANT WITH TEARS
1235-135883-0013 PROTESTED HE WAS INNOCENT BEWAILED HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN AND SUPPLICATED THE GENIE IN THE MOST MOVING EXPRESSIONS THE GENIE WITH HIS CIMETER STILL LIFTED UP HAD THE PATIENCE TO HEAR HIS UNFORTUNATE VICTIMS TO THE END OF HIS LAMENTATIONS

1235-135883-0020 HE WAS AGREEABLY SURPRISED WHEN HE FOUND THE PRINCE ENTERED THE COUNCIL CHAMBER WITHOUT GIVING HIM THE FATAL ORDERS HE EXPECTED THE SULTAN ACCORDING TO HIS CUSTOM SPENT THE DAY IN REGULATING HIS AFFAIRS AND WHEN THE NIGHT HAD CLOSED IN RETIRED WITH SCHEHERAZADE

1235-135883-0030 THE MERCHANT BEING RECOVERED FROM HIS TERROR MOUNTED HIS HORSE AND PROCEEDED ON HIS JOURNEY
1235-135883-0031 BUT GRIEVED ON THE OTHER WHEN HE REFLECTED ON HIS FATAL OATH WHEN HE REACHED HOME HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN RECEIVED HIM WITH ALL THE DEMONSTRATIONS OF PERFECT JOY BUT HE INSTEAD OF RETURNING THEIR CARESSES WEPT SO BITTERLY
1235-135883-0032 THAT HIS FAMILY APPREHENDED SOMETHING CALAMITOUS HAD BEFALLEN HIM
1235-135883-0033 WE ARE ALL OVERJOYED SAID SHE AT YOUR RETURN BUT YOU ALARM US BY YOUR LAMENTATIONS PRAY TELL US THE CAUSE OF YOUR SORROW ALAS REPLIED THE HUSBAND I HAVE BUT A YEAR TO LIVE

1235-135883-0035 THE CHILDREN ALL IN TEARS MADE THE HOUSE RESOUND WITH THEIR GROANS AND THE FATHER NOT BEING ABLE TO RESIST THE IMPULSE OF NATURE MINGLED HIS TEARS WITH THEIRS SO THAT IN A WORD THEY EXHIBITED THE MOST AFFECTING SPECTACLE POSSIBLE
1235-135883-0036 ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING THE MERCHANT APPLIED HIMSELF TO PUT HIS AFFAIRS IN ORDER AND FIRST OF ALL TO PAY HIS DEBTS HE MADE PRESENTS TO HIS FRIENDS GAVE LIBERAL ALMS TO THE POOR
1235-135883-0037 HE GAVE HER IN ADDITION AS MUCH AS THE LAW WOULD ALLOW HIM AT LAST THE YEAR EXPIRED AND HE WAS OBLIGED TO DEPART HE PUT HIS BURIAL CLOTHES IN HIS WALLET BUT WHEN HE CAME TO BID HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN ADIEU THEIR GRIEF SURPASSED DESCRIPTION
1235-135883-0038 WHEN HOWEVER IT BECAME NECESSARY FOR HIM TO TEAR HIMSELF FROM THESE DEAR OBJECTS HE ADDRESSED THEM IN THE FOLLOWING TERMS MY DEAR WIFE AND CHILDREN I OBEY THE WILL OF HEAVEN IN QUITTING YOU FOLLOW MY EXAMPLE
1235-135883-0039 SUBMIT WITH FORTITUDE TO THIS NECESSITY AND CONSIDER THAT IT IS THE DESTINY OF MAN TO DIE HAVING THUS SPOKEN HE WENT OUT OF THE HEARING OF THE CRIES OF HIS FAMILY AND PURSUING HIS JOURNEY ARRIVED ON THE DAY APPOINTED
1235-135883-0040 AN OLD MAN LEADING A HIND APPEARED AND DREW NEAR HIM
1235-135883-0041 BROTHER MAY I ASK WHY YOU ARE COME INTO THIS DESERT PLACE WHICH IS POSSESSED SOLELY BY EVIL SPIRITS AND WHERE CONSEQUENTLY YOU CANNOT BE SAFE FROM THE BEAUTIFUL TREES WHICH ARE SEEN HERE ONE MIGHT INDEED SUPPOSE THE PLACE INHABITED
1235-135883-0042 HE THEN SEATED HIMSELF BY THE MERCHANT AND THEY ENTERED INTO CONVERSATION BUT I SEE DAY SAID SCHEHERAZADE AND MUST LEAVE OFF YET THE BEST OF THE STORY IS TO COME THE SULTAN RESOLVING TO HEAR THE END OF IT
1235-135883-0043 SUFFERED HER TO LIVE THAT DAY ALSO THE NEXT MORNING DINARZADE MADE THE SAME REQUEST TO HER SISTER AS BEFORE MY DEAR SISTER SAID SHE
1235-135883-0044 BUT THE SULTAN WISHING TO LEARN WHAT FOLLOWED BETWIXT THE MERCHANT AND THE GENIE BADE HER PROCEED WITH THAT WHICH SHE DID AS FOLLOWS SIR WHILE THE MERCHANT AND THE OLD MAN WHO LED THE HIND WERE CONVERSING
1235-135883-0045 THEY SAW ANOTHER OLD MAN COMING TOWARDS THEM FOLLOWED BY TWO BLACK DOGS
1235-135883-0046 THE OLD MAN WITH THE HIND TOLD HIM THE ADVENTURE OF THE MERCHANT AND GENIE WITH ALL THAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN THEM PARTICULARLY THE MERCHANT'S OATH
1235-135883-0047 THEY HAD SCARCELY BEGUN TO CONVERSE TOGETHER WHEN THERE ARRIVED A THIRD OLD MAN LEADING A MULE HE ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO THE TWO FORMER AND ASKED WHY THE MERCHANT WHO SAT WITH THEM LOOKED SO MELANCHOLY THEY TOLD HIM THE REASON
1235-135883-0048 WHICH APPEARED TO HIM SO EXTRAORDINARY
1235-135883-0049 THE MERCHANT AND THE THREE OLD MEN BEGAN TO LAMENT AND FILL THE AIR WITH THEIR CRIES WHEN THE OLD MAN WHO LED THE HIND SAW THE GENIE LAY HOLD OF THE MERCHANT AND ABOUT TO KILL HIM
1235-135883-0050 I WILL TELL YOU THE HISTORY OF MY LIFE AND OF THE HIND YOU SEE AND IF YOU THINK IT MORE WONDERFUL AND SURPRISING THAN THE ADVENTURE OF THE MERCHANT I HOPE YOU WILL PARDON THE UNFORTUNATE MAN A THIRD OF HIS OFFENCE
